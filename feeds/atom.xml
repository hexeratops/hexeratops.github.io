downright ignored things. To be fair, I understand it completely! Documenting is boring, it's slow, 
it's unglamorous, it often needs updating to stay relevant, it's generally not appreciated by other
developers on the team... All in all, it's honestly a major pain. Compared to writing code and even 
writing unit tests, documenting is an unfun slog in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I'd argue in modern times, documentation is even more important than ever. If you
have a project you intend for other people to use, you owe it to them, to your team and to 
yourself to write good documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Write Documentation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is fairly obvious: to simply explain just how to use what you've made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, when someone wants to know how to use your library, the last thing they want
to do is read your code. If I need to read the python code of a library to figure out how to
get started, I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; move on to something else. The same goes for header files, telling someone 
to read your header file to figure out your classes is just as bad and lazy. I don't want to have
to read code for half an hour to end up determining that a library isn't a good fit for my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good documentation saves time for everyone involved. Instead of your potential users needing to 
spend hours reading your code to figure out if your library can actually help them or not, they can 
just look at the documentation to see if its a good fit. From documentation, you can quickly determine
the capabilities of the library and figure out how to use it in the way they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem is the rise of AI and poor documentation only further increases its relevance.
Imagine you have a complicated library like OpenCV, but it doesn't give you meaningful examples to
accomplish simple goals. Previously, you'd probably Google it, go to Reddit or StackOverflow or end
up on Discord to ask other developers. These days? You can just ask an AI to generate the sample code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a horrible state of affairs when you come across a project so poorly explained that you need
to ask an AI how a feature works or to get a starting point for your project. I don't like where
this AI stuff is going, but I also value my time. When I come across a project with poor documentation,
I'm not above asking Bing or ChatGPT what to do. It also never stubbornly says "Why are you trying to 
do X when you could do Y?", or "Have you tried Googling it?" which are major frustrations of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is it Good Enough?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue the following types of documentation aren't enough to fully document how a library
works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Header Files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source Code Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descriptions of classes/structs/functions in isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problems with these are that they describe things in isolation. This is great if you
already have a picture in your head for using a library. If you're just trying to put some
functionality together, this is useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine for a second that you're a fresh developer, trying to figure out a simple "hello world"
program in C. Now picture that there's no examples of how to use printf and you're advised to read
the man page on how it works. If you're trying to do something super niche, the man-page is great.
But all the guy needs to do is &lt;code&gt;printf("Hello world!\n")&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that bugs me quite a bit about documentation generators from comments, such as
Doxygen and Rustdoc. They document functions and structs in pains-taking detail, but you don't get
the full picture of how everything fits together or examples of common and not-so-common tasks for 
the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What to Do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples, examples, examples, examples, examples! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ballmer - developers developers" src="https://www.derpybox.ca/images/developers-ballmer.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build multiple common examples for your user. It's great having a simple example to get someone
going off the bat, but what really helps a lot is having numerous examples showing different
uses of your library. If I could give a massive shoutout to one library that absolutely does
this right, it's &lt;a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/c/example.html"&gt;libcurl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at all these examples accomplishing different goals. On top of that, the code is
meant to be short and sweet at the expense of ignoring error checks. This is where you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;
use the function-by-function documentation to ensure you're using the library correctly and catching
all error cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use your unit tests as documentation to show what error conditions can happen and how 
to check for them. I'd argue this partially falls under the previous section and that people shouldnt
have to read your code to understand how to use your library. I don't think code should only be documented
by unit tests, but it's important to have them and they can potentially act as proof of concept code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other mechanisms I described in the previous section are also helpful. Commenting your header files
and creating isolated documentation for your functions and classes are helpful, but I think examples
are the primary driver for their usefulness. Examples can give someone the big picture to start using
a library while the detailed documentation can help them use it right and be driven to other functionality
they hadn't noticed yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh...&lt;/em&gt; This was just a big rant. I wanted to emphasize how important it is to have good documentation
because I hate when I come across a great project where the documentation is missing. So please, if
you're releasing something for people to use, please make sure you explain what you've done and how
other people can make use of it properly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="development"></category><category term="Software"></category></entry><entry><title>Debian Stable for a Month</title><link href="https://www.derpybox.ca/debian-stable-for-a-month.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-11-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>LuckyStoat</name></author><id>tag:www.derpybox.ca,2023-11-25:/debian-stable-for-a-month.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to install Debian and stick with stable for a month. And it went rather well!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a problem: I... I am a distro hopper. I can't permanently settle on just
one Linux distribution. I may settle on one for a few months, but I'll eventually
get bored and want to go explore what another distribution is offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried virtually all the most common Linux distros, including but not limited
to Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Arch, Fedora, OpenSUSE, KDE neon, MX Linux, Elementary,
Bodhi, Puppy, Void, PCLinuxOS, Solus, Alpine, Mageia and many, many more. Which
does honestly beg the question: why? What am I looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well in some cases, there was a genuine need. Puppy, for instance, I needed for
a computer which didn't have a hard drive. Some were for curiosity sake, such as
Mageia and Alpine.  Most though were because I was bored and wanted to explore
what they had to offer in contrast to what I was running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a bit of a flip-flop relationship with the idea of a stable desktop.
Reliability is an important trait to me, but I also like having the newest and
shiniest things. I mean, who doesn't? Unfortunately with many distros, these two
things are in conflict with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian is famously stable with its 2-year update cycle. If you want things to just
work and keep working, look no further. On the complete flip-side, you have rolling
release distros like Arch, Void and Gentoo which never settle and just constantly
push out updates. Once you install it, you never have to do a major distribution
upgrade. The downside though is you never get that exciting headline, "Arch 23.11
has released! Here's what's new!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the upside is that whenever a distro is doing one of those major updates,
it isn't that big of a deal. With a rolling system, chances are that you already
&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; most of those new packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debian Stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I've used Debian before a couple of times. However, I've always
used Debian Testing as a pseudo-rolling distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Debian has a package progression system where a package
is first added to its Sid repository for preliminary testing, then it progresses
into the testing repository. 6 months before the new stable version is released,
the Testing repository is frozen and only bug fixes and security patches are added
to it. Once it's deemed ready, that repository becomes the new stable and the cycle
begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't confident enough to use pure Sid, but I was confident enough to stay on
testing for most of my work. I can't remember running into any breakages. But after
some time, I presumably got bored and went to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time though, I tried using Debian Stable. A few things were different this time
than the last time I used Debian, most critically the addition of Flatpaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flatpak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flatpak is an application sandboxing utility. It allows you to download an application
and its dependencies in isolation from the rest of the system. There are other
technologies similar to this for Linux, such as Snap and AppImage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially a really good thing for Debian though. Here's the logic: Debian
is famous for its stability, but because of that stability, it will only package
security fixes in its stable edition. As such, when Debian Stable is reaching its
end of life after a year, the userland software can become rather stale and outdated.
With Flatpak though, you can install the latest apps on Debian without needing to
abandon that reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flatpaks are updated in isolation from the rest of the system and do not depend
on system-level libraries. That way, you can allow Debian Stable to keep those
libraries stable and secure while you can still enjoy the latest versions of your
favourite applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some downsides to flatpaks though, such as the download sizes involved
and the configuration can be a little bit weird compared to natively installed
programs. The file size problem is more because each flatpak has to be packaged
with all its dependencies since you're not relying on system resources. The configuration
problem is due to the sandboxing, where some of the application settings need to be
managed in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this could be an interesting experiment to try, using Flatpak for my
everyday applications and Debian Stable for my OS Core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Debian Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was genuinely impressed with how well this worked. Debian is a fantastic desktop,
everything more or less worked just as intended! It found my network printer right
out of the box. (Note, I'm using an AMD GPU so I didn't have to deal with NVidia
or really installing any non-free software.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flatpak gave me a fairly good experience. Firefox worked perfectly and I was able
to use programs like VSCode, Gimp and all without much trouble. I did have to do
some tricks with the command line to get them to work nicely with Wayland, but it
wasn't too much trouble and I only had to do it once. After that, Flatpak automatically
kept them all up to date without much fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updates were a nice change of pace too. A week after installation, I ran apt
upgrade and only had 3 packages wanting to be updated. At this point, I was used
to Fedora or Arch systems where you run the update command and you get like 30
different libraries you don't care about all wanting to update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a great experience overall. However, there was one thing that was a bit
frustrating: the desktop itself couldn't be a Flatpak. Gnome 43 is what you get
for the next year and a half. I mean don't get me wrong, it's a great release
and everything works as expected, but I like a little excitement in my life. I
could switch over to testing to get Gnome 44.5, but that kind of defeats the
point of my experiment. It could introduce instabilities in my core setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have kept living like that, but the trouble is that I got bored. It was
simply TOO reliable, too stable. If I were running a desktop where I HAD to have
100% uptime for productivity, I could have ran that setup for years. However, I'm
not that kind of user and I like to tinker with things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, while Flatpak is an interesting technology, I felt less in control
of what I was running on my system. The sandboxing adds a weird layer between
the programs I'm running and everything else. For example, Firefox would
always initially try to download to some weird file location burried deep inside
its sandbox instead of the logical ~/Downloads folder. Launching apps is also
fairly verbose from the CLI, instead of running 'firefox' in a terminal, you'd
launch 'flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did enjoy this little experiment and I think if you just wanted to get things done, you
could easily live with a setup like this. This experience is likely what immutable
systems like Vanilla OS, Fedora Silverblue and OpenSUSE MicroOS are trying to
accomplish, where you have a rock-solid base with custom packages installed in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I've seen of those immutable systems, I'd actually vouch for Debian
before using any of those. You aren't restricted to only using Flatpak, you can break out
and use apt or tweak files in the root file system if you need to. At the end of
the day, it's still a standard Linux distribution that you can manage how you like.
Debian Stable itself has proven to be incredibly stable and a fantastic system
to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to the release of Debian Trixie where I'm sure I'm going to
visit it again. Perhaps... In a Virtual Machine? (Haha, just a bit of a joke.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="social"></category><category term="banter"></category></entry><entry><title>I Hosted my own Social Media Site</title><link href="https://www.derpybox.ca/i-hosted-my-own-social-media-site.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>LuckyStoat</name></author><id>tag:www.derpybox.ca,2023-08-29:/i-hosted-my-own-social-media-site.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried hosting my own social media site. Here's how it went!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;fedi.derpybox.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For about a month, I hosted a little server on fedi.derpybox.com. This was my own
private instance of Pleroma, a service compatible with communicating with Mastodon
servers and other similar services. The whole deal with the fediverse in general
is that anyone can run their own instance and use it to send content to the rest
of the network. Think of it kind of like email or IRC where you have lots of 
different servers and clients talking the same protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, I set up Pleroma on my instance instead of full Mastodon. There were
a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of Deployment. You didn't have to set up SMTP for a simple instance to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware requirements. I was hosting on digital ocean, I could get away with a 14
dollar/month VM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to try something different. I was familiar with Mastodon's UI at that point
and wanted something new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the guide on the main site for setting up my VM, tweaked my DNS settings
to redirect the fed prefix, figured out how to configure Nginx and we were off to the
races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something nobody told me was upon finishing the user setup, there was no content.
It turns out that Pleroma requires you to start following people before content
starts appearing from other servers. So I followed a group of users and started
posting from it. I did quick little movie reviews and shared pokemon I captured
in Pokemon New Snap. This went fine until about a month when I got adventurous...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;fed.derpybox.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first month, I... messed up. I got curious about a fork called Akkoma.
Akkoma is a fork of Pleroma which includes some nifty features, like having a
pane open to view toots from other servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through the upgrade process, fixed up my database and everything seemed
to work. The UI looked great, I played around with the feeds feature, everything
seemed to work great... until I noticed the inbound feed from other servers. It 
was just &lt;em&gt;pouring&lt;/em&gt; in! I would have been happy if this was the first attempt I made
at installing my instance, but I didn't want this now. I only really cared about the
people I was following, and all these people were coming from servers from all over,
even NSFW instances that I didn't want to associate with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an interesting side note, it appears different fediverse services have different
methods of federation. I remember finding a Spanish blog post of someone trying
to explain the differences between Mastodon, Pleroma and Akkoma. He noticed a similar
thing with Akkoma and was very confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 7 hours of my server chugging away at the inbound feeds, I stopped it and
migrated my server from fedi.derpybox.com to fed.derpybox.com. I reinstalled
pleroma and got everything back under control. I used my server happily for
another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The end&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, towards the start of September, I decided to pull the plug on hosting
my own instance. What caused the end was the realization that while the people I
followed are generally good people, I couldn't vet everything that came in the
federated feed. It was more or less an uncontrolled deluge of content that I didn't
monitor or frankly even care about. If something nasty appeared there and ended up
getting stored on my server, I'd be none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though my server was a single user instance only for me, I still had
a legal and ethical duty to be the admin and ensure everything was above board.
I was running a single-user instance to avoid this, I didn't want to have this
role. I also made the realization that if something horrible &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make its way
into my server, I'm not the right type of person to deal with this type of evil
stuff. I'm frankly too sensitive for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to mastodon.social&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before truly shutting down, I setup an alias to my account over at mastodon.social
and transferred my account over there. I lost my content, but I kept my followers
and imported my follower list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that I don't actually own the data on someone else's server, but as I said
since the very start, I don't want to be responsible for other peoples' data. It's
a sacrifice I'm willing to make to not have to be an admin. The other thing is that 
anything said on the fediverse is pretty much public. Since your profile data and 
comments are sent to other servers, there's realistically no way to wipe it out from 
everywhere. For example, if you deleted your email address, everyone you sent emails
to would still have your messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positive outcome to all this is that I learned a lot when it comes to web hosting
and knowing how the fediverse kind of works. I've found some interesting users along
the way, shoutouts to the &lt;a href="https://johto.substack.com/"&gt;Johto Times Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also still on Mastodon, and for the purposes of my blog, this is my preferred method
of contact. Please feel free to reach out at &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@LuckyStoat"&gt;LuckyStoat@mastodon.social&lt;/a&gt;
if you want to leave any comments, have any feedback or just want to chat. I'll be there!
And who knows, maybe in the future if the fediverse gets better controls over the content
which gets shared between servers, perhaps I'll relaunch fedi.derpybox.com once more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="social"></category><category term="banter"></category></entry><entry><title>Building your own geolocation API</title><link href="https://www.derpybox.ca/building-your-own-geolocation-api.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>LuckyStoat</name></author><id>tag:www.derpybox.ca,2019-06-04:/building-your-own-geolocation-api.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How to develop your own geolocation API and avoid third party services like Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One cool project I worked on was building up a geolocation API. 
This service obtains a latitude and longitude via web request and responds back
with the closest city to that location. Well, to be more accurate, it provides
more than just the city; it provides the country, the province, the primary
language and a whole bunch of other bits of metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to go at this that I know of if you want to build something in-house.
The first way (and the one we didn't use) is to use OpenStreetMaps. OSM provides
location information in the form of a Postgresql database. You can host your own
instance with docker and use the database to find the closest location to a given point through
standard queries. The second way is using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoNames"&gt;GeoNames&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GeoNames is a free database available under creative commons. They deserve a lot
more attention than what they get. They provide CSV files of geographical data,
including the coordinates of the locations, the name, what the point is, population
and more. It's an amazing data set that can be used for a lot of purposes; especially
when you consider how rare it is to find geological resources that aren't proprietary
or heavily restricted. You would think information about our world would be available
to the community, but it sure as heck ain't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSV is a relatively easy format to parse; the tricky part is figuring out how to
use the data efficiently. These files are several gigabytes in size; doing a brute
force for-loop through the dataset isn't going to be nearly fast enough. One solution
is to build a very specific kind of datastructure; a k-dimensional tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree"&gt;&lt;img alt="KD Tree" src="https://www.derpybox.ca/images/KdTree/KDTree-animation.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to go &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; computer sciency on you. At each level of the tree, you
compare either the X dimension or Y dimensions of your data and navigate down one
of the branches based on some easy rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at the root node:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_best&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;current_node&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have this repeating pattern alternating X and Y checks.
At each level, you're choosing to navigate down the left or right branch by comparing
your requested position against the node stored at that particular level. If your
value is less than the node, you go left; otherwise, you go right. As you navigate
down the levels, you're also doing comparisons to try to keep track of the closest
node to your location. This pattern continues until you reach the terminating
leaf node. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain level of complexity involved in building up the tree. There's
no hard rule on what node belongs to what level, meaning you can potentially end up with
an unbalanced tree. A solution to this is to take on some additional complexity
when building the tree and choose the midpoints based on median values.
If the middle node is the median, you should expect to see an equal depth level 
on both sides of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside to this approach is that if you start changing it after construction 
by adding more nodes and erasing other nodes, you're likely going to need to 
recalculate your entire tree to make it balanced again. You also might not want
a balanced tree; perhaps one type of search is way more common than the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lookups are incredibly fast at O(log n) efficiency if you can get this working. 
You can easily request thousands of points in bulk with the vast amount of 
your overhead being the transport medium. (ie: TCP being slow.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree"&gt;Wikipedia offers an example in Python&lt;/a&gt; on how to implement the algorithm. Alternatively, 
you can probably find a nice library that implements it. At any rate, once you've 
loaded the data into the k-d tree, you're basically done! Just wrap up your 
search method in a web or socket API and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="development"></category><category term="Geolocation"></category></entry><entry><title>Where did /home go?...</title><link href="https://www.derpybox.ca/where-did-home-go.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>LuckyStoat</name></author><id>tag:www.derpybox.ca,2019-06-02:/where-did-home-go.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I swear, every time I try starting up my blog again, something explodes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I must be cursed as a blogger. Every time I start writing articles,
something stupid happens. This time, my distro-hopping ways have finally
caught up with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's rewind a bit; about a week ago, I decided to change my Linux distro because
I wanted to try out what's happening in KDE. I downloaded Neon as it's
basically Ubuntu + the latest version of KDE. Upon installing it, I started
receiving numerous errors that there were bad sectors on my disk. I could
barely login let alone do anything useful. So I went back to the live USB
and ran fsck on the drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at that moment that I knew I royally fscked up. Its solution was
to essentially destroy my home directory. Everything I had; gone. No matter! I have
a backup folder!... Or rather, had. At some point, I accidentally formatted the
drive. After panicking for about 10-15 minutes, I realized I had a backup of 
my most important files on an external drive. Thankfully, my old backup was
there and worked. I didn't regain everything, but I retained my most important
files that I can't replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I calmed down, I learned something interesting. fsck doesn't
exactly nuke everything; it tries to recover what it can and inserts the
files it can recover into the lost+found folder on your hard drive root.
Well, it's not exactly pretty. The folder names are mangled into unreadable 
names, but you can still recover a fair bit with some bash wizardry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning about the existance of Lost+Found, I ran the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;foo@bar:~$ &lt;/span&gt;find&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;../lost+found/&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;~/derp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basically created a file index for me to go through with vim. There are
too many files to manually browse through in terminal, so I created a little 
index of everything there. And believe it or not, I'd say 98% of my home directory
was there. I just had to dig down to the right folder and pick up my stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're ever in the same situation, have a dig down in the lost+found. You'll
never know what you'll find. Honestly though, you don't want to end up in this 
position in the first place. Back up your stuff and make sure your stuff is being 
backed up on a semi-regular basis. If you don't do that, at least make sure to have
copies of your most valuable files on a USB drive or an external drive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="social"></category><category term="banter"></category></entry><entry><title>First look at Mycroft</title><link href="https://www.derpybox.ca/first-look-at-mycroft.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>LuckyStoat</name></author><id>tag:www.derpybox.ca,2019-05-24:/first-look-at-mycroft.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A look at the open source AI voice assistant&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Smart home technology. Great in theory, kind of scary in practice. In particular,
smartspeaker systems like Amazon Alexa and Google Home are quite scary. They're
closed devices which virtually everyone knows is spying on them; yet people
use them anyway. And honestly, I kind of can't blame them. Smartspeakers are frankly
a really neat idea. Kind of like in Star Trek where people were able to speak with
the onboard computer to trigger actions and commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about getting one of these things for fun and to see what I could do
with it. Internally though, I couldn't get the thought out of my mind that I was
essentially inviting BonziBuddy to sit in my bedroom. Then I remembered a certain
kickstarter project; Mycroft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few weeks back, I purchased the Mycroft Mark 1. Mycroft is a free and open
source voice assistant; it can be downloaded as a service on your local machine,
embedded into a Raspberry Pi 3 or purchased online. I have numerous Raspberry Pis
around my home and I could have just reused one of those, but you can't deny...
the shell of the mark 1 is pretty aborable with it's big LED eyes and text display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark 1" src="https://www.derpybox.ca/images/Mycroft/mark-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the Mycroft different from the other voice assistants is that it's
entirely under your control. You can actually SSH into it and change its behaviour.
All of its &lt;em&gt;skills&lt;/em&gt;, as its behaviours are called, can be freely removed or you
can go online and add new skills from the mycroft home service. You can also
use the msm tool in ssh (Mycroft Skills Manager) to easily pull in skills from 
decentralized sources like github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skills themselves are developed in Python, as is the core of the service.
That means the entire thing is hackable. If you need to change how a particular
skill behaves or even how the core itself behaves, you can easily go in with vim,
do your changes and that's it. No recompilation and most of the time, you don't even
need to reboot the device. The central process automatically reimports skills 
you've changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how it works, you call out to it "Hey Mycroft", then give it a command.
Your command gets sent to a server and gets turned into text. That text is then
locally processed on the device through a series of regex expressions. If the 
regex for a particular skill matches, that skill gets invoked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only data they get; your voice for the purposes of speech to text.
They don't control what context that speech gets used for or even
know what skill you're trying to use. They've also expressed interest in trying
to make it easy to host their service locally so you don't need to send them
recordings of your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as a product for your grandparents, I would hold back at least until the mark 2. 
The mark 1 is great, but it's definitely more geared towards developers and people 
who want to tinker with the platform. The mark 2 is overall a more polished revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark 2" src="https://www.derpybox.ca/images/Mycroft/Mark II logo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a product for a hardware/software developer, I would whole-heartedly recommend
it. Having a voice assistant you can freely control and extend is incredible.
If something is missing, you can just build it yourself. Or chances are someone
in the python community has already got you most of the way there with a library
or two. In the future, I'll talk a bit about the youtube skill I developed and 
what was involved in getting Mycroft to play youtube videos for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: it's nowhere near as hard to develop skills as you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;

I've decided to bring this blog back to life. I tried my hand at
this kind of thing before, but it became more of a chore than something I did for fun. 
I'll be trying to avoid that by treating posts as a long form of twitter with fairly 
minimal editing. I'll talk about some  cool stuff I've been working on, any 
interesting projects I've came across on the web, the typical stuff. I'll also 
sometimes talk about my interests and social stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work full time as a software developer. I mostly work with C, C++, C# and Python
and they're basically my main toolbox languages. I also know JavaScript and
PHP, but I try to avoid web development as much as I can. UI is hard. There are
a few other languages I know enough to use if they're particularly suited for a
project, like Java, Ruby, Lua and Rust, but I'm not as comfortable with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my CMS on this blog, I'm using &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a good thing for multiple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It generates static websites that are easy to deploy where ever I want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't need to create and manage my own style unless I really want to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A static website means I'm discouraged from extending it with my own microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It lets me write my articles in vim~&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, expect to see some (hopefully) interesting articles. There will be no
commenting system. I attempted to add Disqus, but I kind of talked myself out
of it. I have no interest in moderating the thing and I don't like the idea of
adding in dependencies which could be harvesting data in ways I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="social"></category><category term="banter"></category></entry></feed>
