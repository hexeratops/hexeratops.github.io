          <h2>fedi.derpybox.com</h2>
<p>For about a month, I hosted a little server on fedi.derpybox.com. This was my own
private instance of Pleroma, a service compatible with communicating with Mastodon
servers and other similar services. The whole deal with the fediverse in general
is that anyone can run their own instance and use it to send content to the rest
of the network. Think of it kind of like email or IRC where you have lots of 
different servers and clients talking the same protocol.</p>
<p>At any rate, I set up Pleroma on my instance instead of full Mastodon. There were
a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ease of Deployment. You didn't have to set up SMTP for a simple instance to work.</li>
<li>Hardware requirements. I was hosting on digital ocean, I could get away with a 14
dollar/month VM.</li>
<li>I wanted to try something different. I was familiar with Mastodon's UI at that point
and wanted something new.</li>
</ol>
<p>I followed the guide on the main site for setting up my VM, tweaked my DNS settings
to redirect the fed prefix, figured out how to configure Nginx and we were off to the
races.</p>
<p>Something nobody told me was upon finishing the user setup, there was no content.
It turns out that Pleroma requires you to start following people before content
starts appearing from other servers. So I followed a group of users and started
posting from it. I did quick little movie reviews and shared pokemon I captured
in Pokemon New Snap. This went fine until about a month when I got adventurous...</p>
<h2>fed.derpybox.com</h2>
<p>After the first month, I... messed up. I got curious about a fork called Akkoma.
Akkoma is a fork of Pleroma which includes some nifty features, like having a
pane open to view toots from other servers.</p>
<p>I went through the upgrade process, fixed up my database and everything seemed
to work. The UI looked great, I played around with the feeds feature, everything
seemed to work great... until I noticed the inbound feed from other servers. It 
was just <em>pouring</em> in! I would have been happy if this was the first attempt I made
at installing my instance, but I didn't want this now. I only really cared about the
people I was following, and all these people were coming from servers from all over,
even NSFW instances that I didn't want to associate with.</p>
<p>As an interesting side note, it appears different fediverse services have different
methods of federation. I remember finding a Spanish blog post of someone trying
to explain the differences between Mastodon, Pleroma and Akkoma. He noticed a similar
thing with Akkoma and was very confused.</p>
<p>About 7 hours of my server chugging away at the inbound feeds, I stopped it and
migrated my server from fedi.derpybox.com to fed.derpybox.com. I reinstalled
pleroma and got everything back under control. I used my server happily for
another month.</p>
<h2>The end</h2>
<p>Finally, towards the start of September, I decided to pull the plug on hosting
my own instance. What caused the end was the realization that while the people I
followed are generally good people, I couldn't vet everything that came in the
federated feed. It was more or less an uncontrolled deluge of content that I didn't
monitor or frankly even care about. If something nasty appeared there and ended up
getting stored on my server, I'd be none the wiser.</p>
<p>Even though my server was a single user instance only for me, I still had
a legal and ethical duty to be the admin and ensure everything was above board.
I was running a single-user instance to avoid this, I didn't want to have this
role. I also made the realization that if something horrible <em>did</em> make its way
into my server, I'm not the right type of person to deal with this type of evil
stuff. I'm frankly too sensitive for that.</p>
<h2>Back to mastodon.social</h2>
<p>Before truly shutting down, I setup an alias to my account over at mastodon.social
and transferred my account over there. I lost my content, but I kept my followers
and imported my follower list.</p>
<p>It's true that I don't actually own the data on someone else's server, but as I said
since the very start, I don't want to be responsible for other peoples' data. It's
a sacrifice I'm willing to make to not have to be an admin. The other thing is that 
anything said on the fediverse is pretty much public. Since your profile data and 
comments are sent to other servers, there's realistically no way to wipe it out from 
everywhere. For example, if you deleted your email address, everyone you sent emails
to would still have your messages.</p>
<p>The positive outcome to all this is that I learned a lot when it comes to web hosting
and knowing how the fediverse kind of works. I've found some interesting users along
the way, shoutouts to the <a href="https://johto.substack.com/">Johto Times Newsletter</a> in particular.</p>
<p>I'm also still on Mastodon, and for the purposes of my blog, this is my preferred method
of contact. Please feel free to reach out at <a href="https://mastodon.social/@LuckyStoat">LuckyStoat@mastodon.social</a>
if you want to leave any comments, have any feedback or just want to chat. I'll be there!
And who knows, maybe in the future if the fediverse gets better controls over the content
which gets shared between servers, perhaps I'll relaunch fedi.derpybox.com once more.</p>
