        <section id="content">
          <p>It was another lovely day in the village of Amity. Amity is a sleepy little community in the heart of Cottonwool Pines, surrounded by a dense region called the deep woods. Amity is the home of numerous animals of all kinds, both carnivores and herbivores, who have learned to live alongside one another in relative harmony. Thanks to this fostered cooperation, the residents have created a safe home all their own, free from many of the struggles they previously faced. And while no place is without its moments of conflict, Amity has enjoyed an era of peace for as long as many of its residents can remember.</p>
<p>On this particular day, the town peacekeeper, Bromley, had some personal business to take care of at the Amity general store. Bromley was a tall and powerful badger, built like an impervious stone wall. Though he often wore leather armour, this was more for show rather than his protection. </p>
<p>He was well known throughout Amity for his courage and strength. As part of his role as a peacekeeper, he put on a reserved disposition and typically held his emotions close to his heart. To him, this ensured others would see him as responsible and capable of protecting them. But even with this image, he couldn't help but break character and smile when he saw children imitating his typical patrols.</p>
<p>As he made his way through the curving cobblestone streets, he had arrived at his destination. An inconspicuous little building with a modest straw thatched roof, and large windows that provided the interior with soft morning light. As Bromley opened the door, he made sure to duck his head under the wooden frame as he entered. He had enough impromptu meetings with that particular plank of wood to commit this to memory.</p>
<p>As Bromley entered the store, he was greeted by the cozy atmosphere that enveloped the establishment. There were several villagers inside, a few foxes conversing with one another over a table and a squirrel seeming deep in thought with a ceramic cup of coffee. Over time, the general store had become a congregation point for Amity. It started with the general store owner adding a few tables when he decided to offer quick meals and coffee, but as time went on, it became a catch-all meeting place for the local gossip.</p>
<p>Beyond the seating area along the back wall was a wide array of various tools, sitting on cracked, custom crafted wooden shelves. While many of the smaller tools were placed on them in an orderly way, there were also shovels, rakes and items for most basic needs hanging from hooks nearby. On those hooks were also a few specialty tools which were... less than conventional. These were small inventions made for one off jobs, made available for anyone who had similar oddly-specific needs.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Bromley?" A short stout marmot called out from behind the counter. The marmot waddled away from the people sitting at the tables to attend to him. His name was Mortimer, the older gentleman who owned the general store. As per usual, he was wearing his favourite pair of overalls; they were what you might consider well-loved, with tears and patches sewn over the knees.</p>
<p>"To what do I owe the pleasure?" His face looked up at him with slight concern, "Hopefully you aren't here looking for someone."</p>
<p>Bromley simply shook his head with his typical stoic neutral visage. "No, Mortimer, everything's fine. I'm starting a project. I'm planning on building a small garden and-"</p>
<p>"A garden?" Mortimer interrupted him, looking at him now with a puzzled look. He put his hands on his hips as he gazed up at him, "Huh... I never though you were the type. Aren't you too busy protecting townsfolk to be tending to vegetables?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not for me", Bromley lowered his head, his ears slightly folding back before continuing, "It's... actually for our local medic, Willow... I thought it might be nice to put together a small community herb garden."</p>
<p>Mortimer couldn't help but chuckle at this uncharactistic showing of emotion, this was an unusual sight for him, "She's really stolen your heart, hasn't she? I haven't seen you like this in years, old friend."</p>
<p>Bromley glanced away from Mortimer hesitantly. He hadn't exactly planned for the shopkeeper to be this observant and was feeling rather vulnerable. "Well no, it's just... She helped me the other day when I was in a really bad spot. I thought it might be nice if I tried repaying her kindness, just a little. I've noticed she's always going in the deep woods for supplies late at night, and-"</p>
<p>Mortimer gently interrupted him once more, putting a hand on Bromley's chest, "And you, being the town protector, want to keep her safe, right? It's only natural."</p>
<p>He looked up at the tall badger with a knowing cheesy grin. His grin revealed his buck teeth, as per usual when he smiled too hard. "Say no more! Of course I'll help you out; I'll lend you the tools you need to start a nice plot." </p>
<p>Mortimer thought for a moment, bringing his paw to his chin, "Heck, you know what? I've got nothing better to do. I'll pitch in a helping hand." He chuckled, pulling on the straps of his suspenders. "A tough creature like you wouldn't know the first thing about building something delicate like a garden!... And naturally, I'll give you all the credit."</p>
<p>Bromley breathed a sigh of relief, scratching the back of his head as he smiled at the marmot, "Thanks, old friend... The usual price?"</p>
<p>Mortimer let out a cheerful belly laugh in response. "Yep! Tea with me on Sunday. And you simply must tell me how she reacts - I'll want to hear every detail."</p>
<hr>
<p>Darkness enveloped Cottonwool Pines as Bromley set out to Willow's house. Warm amber light was illuminated on the white cobblestone squares throughout the town by the lanterns placed considerately around the village. The town was as quiet as a church; the sole sounds being Bromley's own breathing and the crickets chirping their summer song around him. The little wooden bungalows around the square were all shuttered for the day, their residents resting inside awaiting the dawn.</p>
<p>Bromley wasn't exactly an unusual sight in these peaceful moments of the night. It was typical for him to be seen these late hours, holding onto his lantern, watching out for any signs of trouble and being there for anyone who needed help. Of course even though he was on duty, he couldn't resist sitting on a rock or a bench on occasion to gaze up at the stars above him. But tonight was no time for peaceful reflection or poetry. He had a goal.</p>
<p>The village lights faded behind him as he left the residential area. And at last, he had finally made it to Willow's house. Unlike the small bungalows where most villagers lived, her home was very distinct and yet not; she was lodged in a large blue tree on the outskirts of the village. To the uninitiated, it might appear as just another ancient tree at the edge of the wilderness, its bent and gnarled branches camouflaging itself seamlessly into the forest itself. But the signs were obvious if you knew what to look for, specifically a mailbox that was left precariously to hang on one of the gnarled branches reaching down to the ground. The deep crevices of the tree were dark, confirming that she was indeed asleep.</p>
<p>"Psst!"</p>
<p>Bromley looked around in confusion, his ears twitching as he focused to narrow down the source of the sound. But he couldn't see anyone or anything around.</p>
<p>"Oh for Pete... Over here!"</p>
<p>Bromley looked again and saw a clad in black Marmot emerge from a surprisingly tiny bush, tapping his foot in playful annoyance.</p>
<p>"Is a black sweater all it takes to avoid the long arm of the law?" He asked, his eyes squinting with a teasing smile.</p>
<p>"Mortimer?" Bromley asked incredulously, looking at his choice of attire. He was completely in black, if not for his lantern, he might just have melted into the night. "You know," he began slowly, "we're just building a garden right? Not trying to rob her?"</p>
<p>Mortimer huffed, burying his hands in his pockets. "Yes, well... We wouldn't want to be caught, now would we? Not in a critical late night operation like this."</p>
<p>Bromley couldn't help but stifle his laughter, "How did you even fit in there? And more importantly, how's your back feeling?"</p>
<p>"Anyway!", Mortimer changed the subject, taking Bromley's paw in hand, "Follow me, I'll show you what I brought." He led Bromley behind his laughably small bush where somehow, an impressive cache of equipment and tools had been stashed. The old marmot had managed to bring anything they could possibly need. When questioned how he did it, he simply replied with a proud smirk, "I'm resourceful. You try running a store for a few decades, and I'm sure you'd pick up little tricks along the way too." Bromley nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Mortimer started proudly presenting the various items and tools he brought with him, as though he was presenting it to a prospective buyer. "See, here's all the wood we could ever need to make the box, the shovels to dig out the soil along with some hoes to till the soil, even some decorative frames to build some archways I'm sure she'll absolutely love. Did you bring the seeds?"</p>
<p>"Naturally." Bromley replied with a smile, patting the pocket of his tunic. "While I was recovering, I had plenty of time to get to watch how she made her medicines. I went out into the deep woods myself and foraged these from a few plants."</p>
<p>Mortimer beamed. "Excellent work! You know, you really should get into gardening yourself." He gave Bromley a cheerful nudge on the arm. "Now then, let's get started! We've got a long night ahead of us." He waddled over to a plank of wood, clearing some area on it to create a makeshift workbench of sorts. "Bring some of those planks over here and we'll hammer them together to make the frame."</p>
<p>Bromley started to carry the planks of wood over with ease, multiple at a time even, but then he paused in thought. "Are you sure we shouldn't just bury each one individually and then slat them together? Won't this be harder?"</p>
<p>"Who's the expert here?" Replied Mortimer with a confident grin.</p>
<hr>
<p>After two hours of putting the frame together, digging out the foundation, and having a few arguments resulting in them redoing the frame correctly, they finally had a plot of land they could work with. A bit disheveled and damp with sweat, the two proudly surveyed their handiwork, a small clearing of freshly turned earth protected by a buried wooden structure.</p>
<p>"How about we split up the work, Bromley?" Mortimer suggested, "I'll start putting together the decorative parts, you can start working the soil."</p>
<p>Bromley nodded and turned to return to their bush and retrieve a garden hoe, but disaster struck. The shovel they placed so precariously against the smooth bark of Willow's tree fell with a resounding "CLANG!", shattering the night's silence. Both of them looked at each other in silent horror. Bromley looked up, his heart leaping into his throat to see a dazed looking pine marten gazing out the dark opening of the tree hollow... directly at him. Bromley couldn't tell if it was fear, or that warm disarming awe he always felt around her that rooted him in place, but he couldn't move. </p>
<p>"Get. Over. Here!" Hissed Mortimer as he gripped his shoulder and pulled him aggressively towards the tree, pulling them both into a blind-spot.</p>
<p>Willow looked down at the construction site, her tired eyes squinted beneath her long night cap as she clutched a small stuffed fox toy tightly to her chest. Thanks to her eyes being foggy with sleep and her missing glasses, she remained oblivious for the time being.</p>
<p>"Those raccoons again?..." She muttered in her half sleep. "Why must they always pick the night I'm this tired to cause a ruckus?..." She exhaled in almost exhausted defeat, "Hopefully they leave my trash alone. We'll just have to deal with it tomorrow..."</p>
<p>She wandered back into her home, collapsing with an almost inaudible thud on her bed. Meanwhile, Bromley and Mortimer were pressed against the tree paralyzed in fear.</p>
<p>"Do you think she saw?" whispered Bromley.</p>
<p>"How should I know!?" Mortimer hissed, incredulous. "I wasn't the one frozen out there! What do you think?"</p>
<p>They paused as a loud snore erupted from deep within the tree hollow. Both breathed a sigh of relief as they got back to finishing the job without any further trouble. Mortimer put up the decorative arches while Bromley focused on working the soil and planting the seeds. With quiet pride and sore backs, the pair disappeared into the night, leaving behind a pleasant surprise just waiting to bloom in the morning light.</p>
<hr>
<p>The next morning, Bromley returned to the general store; his eyes were a bit wearier than usual. The long night seemingly had no effect on Mortimer one bit; his shelves were already gleaming, cleaned with practiced ease. It was a little busy that day, there were a pair of skunks chatting idly by the window about their plans for the day and a confused looking possum swapping his gaze between a drawing in his mitts and some raw wood on the shelves.</p>
<p>Mortimer was already mid-story, retelling a story he had overheard from a visitor. "-And you'd never believe what he said!" Mortimer exclaimed, "He said that he saw a pair of glowing yellow eyes along the path." Mortimer leaned in with wide eyes, "But then?... poof! Gone without a trace!"</p>
<p>Bromley nodded with a patient smile. This wasn't the first time he was listening to one of Mortimer's stories. He had a tendency of hearing half-conversations and taking them at face value. "Uh-huh... And what do you think it could be?"</p>
<p>The marmot's eyes sparkled excitedly, "I'm glad you asked! Lately, I've been hearing tales of strange spirits in those woods." He paused for a moment seemingly worried, "It couldn't be that, do you think?"</p>
<p>Bromley's ears folded back in amusement as he sipped a coffee that he brought with him from the local cafe, using it to brace himself for another of Mortimer's tales. "I've been in those woods many times. No spirits in there. Wolves, perhaps; maybe bears or other such feral creatures. But in all my years, I've never seen a spirit."</p>
<p>Mortimer was about to argue when the bell above his door rang, and a pine marten clad in a pink kimono and large black glasses walked in. She was absolutely beaming, her brown fluffy tail wagging furiously from side to side as she entered the store. Bromley's heart caught in his throat. This is why he'd come; he knew she would be here. But no amount of mental preparation would have prepared himself for this.</p>
<p>"Willow!" called out Mortimer with a smile, acting like everything was typical. "You certainly seem in a bright mood today, that's nice to see! How can I help you?"</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mortimer, and to you as well, Bromley!" She cheerfully replied, addressing the pair. Bromley responded with a quiet, reserved nod, trying not to let emotion show on his face. He didn't know what to say, deciding for the moment to stay quiet. Willow turned her attention back to Mortimer as she leaned over the counter-top.</p>
<p>"Mortimer, did you lend your tools to anyone lately? It's strange, but while I slept, a kind soul visited and built me a garden in my yard! I just have to know who it was!"</p>
<p>Mortimer gave a soft chuckle, "Indeed, someone did... and wouldn't you know it, the perpetrator sits among us." He pointed at Bromley. Bromley tried not to look too awkward as he looked at Willow with a serious face, not entirely sure what emotion he should be showing. Willow stared back at him, her face a delicate mix of joy, gratitude and surprise.</p>
<p>"Oh, please forgive me you two," interjected Mortimer, causing the pair to turn to him. "I need to write something in my journal. I'll be back." With that, he left the room through a side door. Willow took a small step towards Bromley with a gentle smile on her face.</p>
<p>"So... It was you who was my noisy little racoon last night?" She softly stroked the ponytail resting over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Bromley nodded slowly, completely forgetting about his ceramic cup sitting on the table. "Yes, it was me. S-See, as the town peacekeeper, it's my duty to ensure everyone is safe," he started, trying to mask himself with his usual guarded persona. "I noticed how you would keep returning to the deep woods for your medicinal herb stock, and I couldn't have a resident putting themselves at risk like that."</p>
<p>Willow's smile remained as she leaned forward. "So you've noticed? I had hoped you hadn't. I know the deep woods are dangerous, especially at night, but I never had the chance to find an alternative supply. I just never have enough time." She paused, tilting her head curiously. "I really do appreciate your efforts Bromley... but how did you decide what to plant?"</p>
<p>He folded his arms in almost his rehearsed way, "While I was under your care, I paid attention..." He bit his tongue at the realization of his awful phrasing, "I mean, I noticed the herbs you reached for most often." </p>
<p>Bromley's expression softened, for the life of him, he just couldn't maintain his usual mask. </p>
<p>"So I went to the library...", he continued, his arms dropping back to his sides. "I looked up those herbs I saw you reach for most often. Comfrey, Marigold, Elderflower, Chamomile... During my research, I even found a few others I didn't notice you use like Fennel, but I thought they could be useful so I added them too."</p>
<p>Willow placed a hand over her heart as her ears folded back. She lowered her head as if to shield the growing emotion on her face. "Bromley... that's..."</p>
<p>"I-I could help you replant everything!" He blurted out. "You definitely know this herbalism thing better than me, but... I'd like to help with your guidance."</p>
<p>Willow shook her head, revealing the mist that had completely overwhelmed her spectacles. They were tears; she approached him with sudden speed before wrapping her arms around him in a warm, tender embrace. The silk from her kimono brushed gently against Bromley's coarse fur. "It's perfect..." she whispered to him softly.</p>
<p>For a moment, Bromley didn't move. Then slowly, his arms circle her like a shield. Firm, warm and trembling a little as she buried her face in the crook of his neck. He felt his heart flutter as he surrendered. Whoever else was there to witness this didn't matter, everything else melted away as the pair shared this quiet, tender moment.</p>
<p>The two held one another wordlessly like this, for what to Bromley felt like hours, before she finally gently released him. She took a small step backwards, her head still remaining inches from his face, "Now dear," she said softly, her voice touched with affection, "Do you think you have time to stop by my place on your busy schedule? Perhaps around 6? I'd love to share a meal with you, as my special guest for the night.</p>
<p>Bromley cleared his throat, ears folding back slightly, "A-Ah, right! That'll be... nice! I-I'd be honoured!..."</p>
<p>She started towards the door, a small smirk playing on her face. She could see the effect she was having on the usual shielded Bromley. She had seen glimpses of this side of him before, back when his guard was down as she tended to his injuries. She loved it then, and she adored it now. "Then it's a date!", she replied cheerfully. "We'll see you then, don't keep me waiting!"</p>
<p>He blinked, his tail twitching slightly. A date? Like a real date?... Was she serious or just teasing him? His brain froze as he tried to figure out a response, but all of them were awful. Before he could decide what to say, she gave him a cheerful little wave and slipped out the door, her fluffy tail swaying behind her with unmistakable joy. He stood frozen, trying to process what had happened, but was jolted back to reality from a hearty pat on his back.</p>
<p>"Well done, lad!" Mortimer beamed proudly. "You'd best prepare. Good luck! We'll see you Sunday."</p>
<p>Bromley nodded and left the store to prepare himself for the night ahead of him. He couldn't help but feel his heart flutter. Whether she was teasing him or not didn't matter, the sun felt warm on his fur and his heart impossibly light as he eagerly waited for the evening.</p>
