          <h2>About the Developer</h2>
<p>This site is maintained by yours truly, LuckyStoat. I'm a software developer who
has been messing around with software since I was a child. I was mainly interested
in visual apps, such as GUI programs, and naturally video games. The funny thing
though is that after finally learning how to build that kind of software in college,
I ended up primarily enjoying backend development because you don't have to worry
about the visual components.</p>
<p>But yes, I've been doing software development professionally since 2017. I have a
few hobby projects I work on, but most of my energy is spent at work and on other
endeavours. I would like to work on open-source stuff, but I'm afraid I don't think
I have the energy to allocate for that. I mainly work with C#, but I'm also strong
with C, C++ and Python.</p>
<p>I do have other hobbies, like doing stargazing outside with my telescope, going out
to the movies, playing music and video gaming. I may make blog posts out of these
hobbies once in a while as well.</p>
<h2>About this Site</h2>
<p>This site is just a personal little window for me to talk out to the web through.
I bought derpybox a long time ago because I thought it was a funny domain, and it
kind of summarized what I wanted to do with the site: nothing serious. </p>
<p>This site is for my blog and for longer-form content. I have my Mastodon account
for interacting with other people and posting simpler posts for fun.</p>
<p>I intentionally made things non-interactive with no disqus widgets or methods for
adding comments. This is because I don't want to be trusted with any of your data.
If you want to comment on an article, please feel free to reach out to me over
Mastodon. I won't bite; truth be told, I'm probably a bit more afraid of you than
you are of me. <i class="pelimoji pelimoji-Blobhaj_Default" aria-label="Blobhaj_Default" title="Blobhaj_Default"></i></p>
